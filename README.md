Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for stock price forecasting, helping investors make data-driven decisions. 
By leveraging machine learning and deep learning models, the system provides accurate predictions and insightful visualizations.

Features
✅ Predictive Modeling: Developed a model to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
✅ LSTM Implementation: Used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture complex time-series dependencies and improve forecasting accuracy.
✅ ARIMA & XGBoost: Implemented AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for time-series forecasting and XGBoost for machine learning-based predictions.
✅ Interactive Web Application: Built a user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time visualization and interaction.
✅ Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib & Plotly to present stock trends, model performance, and future predictions in a clear and effective manner.
✅ User Input & Customization: Allows users to select different stocks, adjust timeframes, and compare multiple prediction models.
